# =============================================================================
# This code produces an initial guess for the first TEA iteration by 
# fulfilling the mass balance condition, sum_i(ai_j * y_i) = bj (equation (17) 
# in the TEA theory paper), where i is species index, j is element index, a's
# are stoichiometric coefficients, and b's are elemental fractions by number, 
# i.e., ratio of number densities of element 'j' to the total number densities 
# of all elements in the system (see the end of the Section 2 in the TEA theory
# paper). The code writes the result into machine- and human-readable files. 
#
# The code begins by making a directory for the output results. Then, it reads 
# the header file and imports all relevant chemical data from it. 
# To satisfy the mass balance equation, some yi variables remain as free
# parameters. The number of free parameters is set to the number of total
# elements in the system, thus ensuring that the mass balance equation can 
# be solved for any number of input elements and output species the user 
# chooses. The code locates a chunk of species (y_i) containing a sum of 
# ai_j values that forbids ignoring any element in the system (sum of the 
# ai_j values in a column must not be zero). This chunk is used as a set 
# of free variables in the system. The initial scale for other y_i variables
# are set to a known, arbitrary number. Initially, starting values for the 
# known species are set to 0.1 moles, and the mass balance equation is 
# calculated. If this value does not produce all positive mole numbers, 
# the code automatically sets known parameters to 10 times smaller and 
# tries again. Actual mole numbers for the initial guesses of y_i are 
# arbitrary, as TEA only requires a balanced starting point to initialize
# minimization. The goal of this code is to find a positive set of non-zero
# mole numbers to satisfy this requirement. Finally, the code calculates y_bar,
# initializes the iteration number, delta, and delta_bar to zero and writes
# results into machine- and human-readable output files. 
#
# This code is called by runatm.py and runsingle.py and can be executed alone
# with in-shell input: balance.py <HEADER_FILE> <DIRECTORY_NAME>
