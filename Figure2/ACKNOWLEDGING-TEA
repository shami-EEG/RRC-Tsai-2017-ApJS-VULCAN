HOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE TEA

Thank you for using the Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances (TEA)
code.  In consideration of your access to this code, the license (see
the file RR-LICENSE-0.3.txt) requires that you acknowledge the
original authors and cite the paper describing it in a form
appropriate to the medium of publication.  This file gives
instructions for acknowledging TEA in research publications.

** In peer-reviewed research papers, other article-style academic work
   with references sections (including classwork and textbooks), and
   conference posters:

Cite the TEA paper as appropriate in the main text and include the TEA
paper in the References, Bibliography, or similar section of the
work.  Here is a BibTeX entry for it:

@ARTICLE{BlecicHarringtonBowman2016apjsTEA,
 author = {{Blecic}, Jasmina and
           {Harrington}, Joseph and
           {Bowman}, Matthew Oliver},
 title = "{TEA: A} Code For Calculating {Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances}",
 year = {2016},
 journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
 volume = ,
 pages = 
}

The volume and pages should be filled in; as of this writing they have
not been assigned.

Include the following text in the Acknowledgements section, or
equivalent section that usually appears at the end of the main text,
before the references, depending on journal/article style:

  We thank the developers of the Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances
  (TEA) code <citation to TEA paper>, initially developed at the
  University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA.

The citation should appear in the appropriate format for the journal,
for example:

  We thank the developers of the Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances
  (TEA) code (Blecic et al. 2016), initially developed at the
  University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA.

For example, in LaTeX using the natbib.sty references package and
BibTeX, this would be:

  We thank the developers of the Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances
  (TEA) code \citep{BlecicHarringtonBowman2016apjsTEA}, initially
  developed at the University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida, USA.

** In conference abstracts or the visuals of talks:

Include an in-line citation to the paper, as in:

   We used the Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances (TEA) code of
   Blecic et al. (2016, ApJS xx, yy).

...where xx is the volume and yy is the pages, which should be filled
in once they are known (they have not been assigned as of this
writing).
