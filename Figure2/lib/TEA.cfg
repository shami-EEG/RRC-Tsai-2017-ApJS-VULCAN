# ============================================================================= 
# Configuration file containing two sections: 
# 1. TEA section with parameters and booleans to run and debug TEA.
# 2. PRE-ATM section with parameters to make pre-atmospheric file. 
# ============================================================================= 


# =============================== TEA SECTION =================================
# Change the parameters below to control how TEA runs. The default number of 
# iterations in 'maxiter' parameter is the optimal value for common molecular
# species in hot Jupiters. Following 'maxiter' parameter, next four parameters
# are for debugging purposes only. Setting them to 'False' will ensure the 
# fastest execution.

# (Def: False) Preserve headers

# (Def: False) Preserve intermediate outputs

# === Controls debugging and tracking ===
# (Def: False) Enable various debug printouts

# ============================= PRE-ATM SECTION ===============================
# Execution of this section is optional. The user can produce a TEA
# pre-atmospheric file by running makeatm.py, or make a custom-made file in 
# the format that TEA can read it. See the correct format in the 
# ../TEA/doc/examples/multiTP/ folder.
#
# Change the parameters below to control how pre-atmospheric file is made.
# Before executing the makeatm.py module make a pressure-temperature file. 
# Run makeatm.py as: makeatm.py <DIRECTORY_NAME>
# note: <DIRECTORY_NAME> is the name of the directory that will be made
# below the TEA working directory (see Section 7.1 in the TEA User Guide)
# Example: ../TEA/tea/makeatm.py Jupiter

# === Full path to pressure and temperature file ===

# Use extension .atm. File will be placed in <DIRECTORY_NAME>/atm_inputs/.

# === Input elements names ===
# MUST have names as they appear in periodic table.
